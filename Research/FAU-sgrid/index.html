<HR>
<H2>Obtaining Sgrid</H2>

To get the
<A HREF="https://github.com/sgridsource">Sgrid source code</A>
type:
<PRE>
git clone https://github.com/sgridsource/sgrid.git
</PRE>
Copy the file <A HREF="MyConfig">MyConfig</A> into the newly created sgrid
directory.

<P>
Type:
<PRE>
cd sgrid
make git_clone
</PRE>



<HR>
<H2>Getting and compiling the TEMPLATES library needed for sgrid</H2>

Type:
<PRE>
git clone https://github.com/wofti/Packages.git
</PRE>

<P>
Type:
<PRE>
cd Packages/dctemplates_extBlasLapack
make
</PRE>


<HR>
<H2>Compiling Sgrid</H2>

To compile you need a file called <A HREF="MyConfig">MyConfig</A>.
In it you need to set a few things like the compiler you use or where
certain libraries are located. The file linked here is an example that
works on Debian.
Among other things it has the section:
<PRE>
DFLAGS += -DUMFPACK
SPECIALINCS += -I/usr/include/suitesparse
SPECIALLIBS += -lumfpack -lamd -lblas
</PRE>
<P>
The DFLAGS line says that we want to use the UMFPACK 
library. The SPECIALLIBS lines after that simply describe what
libraries we want to compile in for that. Of course this only works if they
are actually installed. To install them either download
<A HREF="https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/releases">
SuiteSparse</A>
yourself, or follow
<A HREF="https://github.com/wofti/Packages/blob/main/forUMFPACK/Note.txt">
Packages/forUMFPACK/Note.txt</A>,
or if you are e.g. on Debian Linux just install
the package libsuitesparse-dev.
<P>

There is also the section:
<PRE>
DFLAGS += -DTEMPLATES
TEMPLATESDIR = /home/wolf/Packages/dctemplates_extBlasLapack
SPECIALLIBS += -L$(TEMPLATESDIR) -literatortemplates
SPECIALLIBS += -lblas -llapack
</PRE>

The DFLAGS line says that we want to use the TEMPLATES library. The lines
after that describe where this library is, and what libraries we want to
compile in. The TEMPLATES library needs to be first downloaded, and then
compiled (see above).
<P>

Similary we need the GSL library:
<PRE>
DFLAGS += -DGSL
SPECIALLIBS += -lgsl -lgslcblas
</PRE>
<P>


In order to make new initial data for binary neutron stars we need the GSL
and both UMFPACK and TEMPLATES. In this case the lapack and blas libraries
also need to be installed. But if we just need to read in already created
data, with e.g. the data reader in BAM, Cactus or Nmesh, all these lines can
be commented out, because none of these libraries are needed.

<P>

There are now 2 versions of neutron star initial data in Sgrid.
The old private one is called BNSdata and the new public one DNSdata. 
The new DNSdata can create higher mass and spin configurations, and
may also run faster. So it should be preferred. Note that DNSdata also
requires the project EoS_T0.

<P>

<H2>Parameter files for Sgrid</H2>
<!--
Several example parfiles are in
<A HREF="../EccRed/sgrid-parfiles">../EccRed/sgrid-parfiles</A>.
Not all of these are for binaries and thus useful for eccentricity
reduction. The parfiles are described in
<A HREF="../EccRed/sgrid-parfiles/Note.txt">../EccRed/sgrid-parfiles/Note.txt</A>.
-->
Several example parfiles are in
sgrid/src/Projects/DNSdata/ParFiles , with description (to some extent) in
sgrid/src/Projects/DNSdata/ParFiles/Note.txt .


<HR>
<H2>Running Sgrid and BAM</H2>

Sgrid only uses OpenMP, not MPI, so do not run it with mpirun. Just launch
it on a machine with multiple CPU cores.

On Koko, Sgrid and also BAM can also be started with the 
<A HREF="https://github.com/wofti/WTscripts/blob/main/submitjob">submitjob</A>
script found at
<A HREF="https://github.com/wofti/WTscripts">https://github.com/wofti/WTscripts</A>.
For slurm you also need
<A HREF="https://github.com/wofti/WTscripts/blob/main/slurm_mpirun_script">slurm_mpirun_script</A>.


<HR>
<H2>About the non-public git repos of the FAU NR group</H2>

Some Sgrid projects that are still under development reside in the
non-public
<A HREF="../../Software/FAU_NR_RepoAccess.html">FAU NR git repos</A>.
