<H2>Accessing the non-public git repos of the FAU NR group</H2>

All NR repos at FAU are accessed via ssh keys.
The ssh keys only work if they are secured by a good passphrase.

Note that once you have created a (public/private) keypair, you can use it
on any of your computers by simply copying them there. I.e. you need only
one key for our repos!

The only complication is that the server (quark.physics.fau.edu) is behind a
firewall and thus can only be accessed via a bastion host
(bast.hpc.fau.edu). Thus you need to add the following to your .ssh/config :
<PRE>
Host bast-giter
   Hostname bast.hpc.fau.edu
   User giter
   IdentityFile  path_to_private_key_on_local_client

Host quark.physics.fau.edu
   IdentityFile  path_to_private_key_on_local_client
   User giter
   ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p  giter@bast-giter
</PRE>

Once this is done, you should test if ssh is set up correctly. Just type:
<PRE>
ssh giter@quark.physics.fau.edu info
</PRE>
This should list all the repos you can access.

In order to get a repo type:
<PRE>
git clone giter@quark.physics.fau.edu:name_of_repo
</PRE>

<HR>

Note that whenever you make a connection, computers such as
quark.physics.fau.edu or bast.hpc.fau.edu will need your key. To access the
key your key-passphrase is needed. If you want to type this passphrase less
often, you can set up
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent">ssh-agent</A>
or a similar program.

The
<a href="https://github.com/wofti/WTscripts">add-key.py script</a>
can be used for this purpose.

For more info on ssh keys and agents see
<A HREF="ssh.html">ssh.html</A>.
