<H2>Important libraries</H2>

<H3>BLAS and LAPACK</H3>

BLAS contains functions for common linear algebra operations such as vector
addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, linear combinations, and
matrix multiplication. 

<P>

LAPACK relies on BLAS to provide more complicated linear algebra routines
for e.g. solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares,
eigenvalue problems, or matrix factorizations such as LU.

<P>

Many different implementations of BLAS and LAPACK exist. A commonly used one
is OpenBLAS, which contains both BLAS and LAPACK in one library file. I.e.
if one uses OpenBLAS it suffices to add
<PRE>
-lopenblas
</PRE>
to link in support for both BLAS and LAPACK functions.

<P>

In other implementations BLAS and LAPACK are in separate libraries and then
one usually adds
<PRE>
-lblas -llapack
</PRE>
to link in support for BLAS and LAPACK functions.



<H2>Using libraries on supercomputers</H2>

As explained in the
<A HREF="../../Software/CompileNotes.html">Compile Notes</A>
one often also needs to specify the exact directories where the libraries
and their include files reside (i.e. the -L and -I options).
If there are several versions of each library, this can get tedious very
quickly. For this reason many supercomputers have a module system, that can
be used to set up the default search locations for the compiler.
E.g. in order to link with OpenBLAS one would simply type
<PRE>
module load openblas
</PRE>
before compiling. Then the -L and -I options do not need to be given, and
configurations such as MyConfig simplify.

<P>

Unfortunately on FAU's Athene supercomputer some of these modules are broken
so that one still may need to specify some -L and -I options anyway.
