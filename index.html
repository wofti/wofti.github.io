Welcome to my homepage!<P>

My research interests span a broad range of topics including
projects in numerical relativity,
gravitational waves, post-Newtonian theory.

The NSF's LIGO gravitational wave detectors are among a number of new
facilities all over the world which are designed to directly detect and
measure gravitational waves.  These waves come from a variety of
astrophysical sources and open a new window to the universe.  One of
the most promising sources for these detectors are the inspirals and mergers
of compact-object binaries (i.e., systems containing black holes or
neutron stars).  
As the two objects get close, fully
non-linear numerical simulations of the Einstein equations are required to
make predictions about the final part of the inspiral and subsequent merger.

Using the moving puncture approach, it is possible to evolve
compact-object binaries through many orbits, merger and the ringdown of the
final black hole.
The main task is to accurately model different physical problems.
In particular, we are working on several key physics issues such as:
(i) How important is neutron star spin in the evolutions of neutron star
binaries?
(ii) How can we best join a very long post-Newtonian inspiral
waveform and a numerically obtained waveform from a compact object binary?  
(iii) Up to which frequency can post-Newtonian waveforms be trusted, and how
does this frequency depend on spins and mass ratios?
(iv) Can we get significantly better waveforms if we use more realistic
initial data with less artificial "junk" radiation?
(v) We also work on the production of gravitational wave
templates that can be useful for LIGO's data analysis.
A highly efficient computer code is needed to address these issues. We are
using BAM code, that has been developed by the numerical relativity groups
at the University of Jena in Germany and our group Florida Atlantic
University (FAU). Currently we are working on improving BAM's accuracy for
neutron star simulations. At FAU we have also developed a spectral initial
data code (SGRID) that can set up initial conditions for realistic neutron
stars with spin. We are also developing the next generation code Nmesh that
uses discontinuous Galerkin methods to achieve high accuracy simulations.
